# robaho_adapter — integration example

Wraps [robaho/cpp_orderbook](https://github.com/robaho/cpp_orderbook) behind
`api/matching_engine_api.h`. The engine depends on
[robaho/cpp_fixed](https://github.com/robaho/cpp_fixed) for its `Fixed<7>`
price type.

This adapter is one of eight worked examples in `additional_references/` —
none are baselines and none are maintained. See `discoveries.md` at the
repository root for the observations the harness produced against this
snapshot.

## Engine shape

`Exchange` facade + `ExchangeListener` callback, single-threaded matcher.
Native APIs visible from the adapter:

- `Exchange::buy/sell(sessionId, instrument, F price, qty, orderId)` —
  submits a limit order; returns an `exchangeId` (long).
- `Exchange::marketBuy/marketSell` — submits a market order.
- `Exchange::cancel(exchangeId, sessionId)` — returns `int` (0 success).
- `ExchangeListener::onTrade(Trade)` — fires synchronously inside the
  matching loop; carries `aggressor` (taker) and `opposite` (maker) refs.
- `Exchange::book(instrument)` — `Book` snapshot with bid/ask levels.

Not provided natively: no IOC / FOK / POST-ONLY; no native modify;
`std::string` order ids (harness uses `uint64_t`); no Reject events.

## Adapter strategy

- `HarnessListener : ExchangeListener` captures every `onTrade` into a
  thread-local fill buffer that the adapter drains into Trade reports after
  each submit.
- Prices: workload `int64_t` ticks written into `Fixed<7>(int64_t, 0)`
  (stores `ticks * 10^7` as fp). Tick ordering is preserved bit-for-bit
  through Fixed's internal comparator.
- Order-id mapping: `std::to_string(oid)` on submit; `std::stoull` on the
  trade callback.
- **IOC**: post-submit `Exchange::cancel` of the residual + emit `CancelAck`.
- **Modify**: explicit cancel + re-submit (engine has no native modify).
- Shadow map for reject path, CancelAck/ModifyAck side/price echo, and to
  remember the engine's per-order `exchangeId` for `Exchange::cancel`.

A one-token source-level fix is required for C++20 conformance:
`exchange.h` and `bookmap.h` declare `std::vector<const std::string>`, which
is ill-formed under C++20+ (vector of const elements). `build.sh` `sed`s out
the `const`. The methods that use those vectors are not called from the
adapter; pure source-level fix, no semantics change.

## Build / run

```bash
bash additional_references/robaho_adapter/build.sh
./harness --engine robaho_adapter.so --scenario normal --mode audit \
          --matcher-core 82 --drainer-core 83
```

`build.sh` clones the two repos into `third_party/robaho_cpp_orderbook/` and
`third_party/robaho_cpp_fixed/` at the pinned commits, then patches the two
headers. Overrides: `ME_ROBAHO_SRC` and `ME_FIXED_SRC` use existing
checkouts in place of cloning.
